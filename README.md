# Udacity Project - Feed Reader Testing

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. You can clone, fork or download the Zip file and then open the index.html file in your browser. At the bottom of the document, you will see whether the tests have passed or failed. You will need to modify feedreader.js to add new testing specs or change existing specs.
